            <h1>Four things you need to know about dancers</h1>
            <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
                <h1><i>Determination</i></h1>
                <p> Dancers will do anything to get where we need to go to succeed and be “satisfied”. They are determined people. We are people who never give up. There is no such thing as perfect in our vocabulary. There’s always room for improvement. We always want to better ourselves to be the best.
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
                <h1><i>Strength</i></h1>
                <p> Dancers are one of the strongest athletes there are and yes, we are athletes. Dancers do twice as much as any other athlete. We condition, have a class to a few classes, stretch, rehearsal, and a show all in one day. When it’s performance season, sometimes 6 days out of the week. A lot of dancers have a 10 hour day and there is never an off season. Dancers are always dancing no matter what. 
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
               <h1><i>Emotion</i></h1>
               <p>Dancers are emotional wrecks, the stereotype is true. When audition season comes around, tensions rise, friendships end, the focus is all to dance. We all want to get a lead role or just be in the dance in general. Auditions are stressful and it can be even more stressful when you want it so bad but you did not get the part. It makes us feel like we are not good enough. 
</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
                <h1><i>Family</i></h1>
                <p>Dance is what you make of it. Depending on your enviornment, you create a family. Dancers connect with eachother in a way no ordinary person would understand. Dancers understand the struggle and what we are fighting for. No matter how bloody, nasty, violent, cruel, or devious things may get, there is plenty of love to go around for people who have the same common intrest as you.</p>
